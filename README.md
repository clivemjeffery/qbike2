# QBike 2

My cycle training app reimagined for the browser.

## Progress Notes

### Following initial trial and check in April 24

Added a download icon that tries the File System Access Api. Who knew browsers (well Chrome) are allowed to do this now. It just offers a file picker now.

Next step - make a FIT file header and write that to the file. Probably use a `DataView` onto a binary `ArrayBuffer`.

## Notes on Dependencies

### Iconify and unplugin-icons

Both are installed.

I found the ones used mostly in [Iconify for icons](https://iconify.design)

[The Svelte docs](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/svelte/) might also help.
